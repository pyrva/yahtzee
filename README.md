## Game Description

The game of yahtzee is a simple dice game. Each round, each player rolls five six sided dice. The player may choose to reroll some or all of the dice up to three times (including the original roll). The player then places the roll at a category, such as ones, twos, sixes, etc. If the roll is compatible with the score, the player gets a score for this roll according to the rules.
